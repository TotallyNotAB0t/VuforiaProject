# VuforiaProject
 Small AR game where you have to collect gems.

Nomenclature of the project :

In the Assets folder, there are 4 important folders :

- ImportedRessources
    - It contains the multiple ressources used in the project : free assets for the gems, polygon models and the character model.

- Plugins
    - This one contains the free asset used to get the input from the user on a phone, and use it in our program. It's extremly simple to use, I highly recommend it !

- Scenes
    - Here are the Scenes used during the development : one is a Test to practice outside of the Vuforia Scene, in which I did the rest of the tests.

- Scripts
    - Finally, the Scripts folder holds the two Scripts of the minigame : a very little one used to animate the collectables, and the other one that runs the game.
